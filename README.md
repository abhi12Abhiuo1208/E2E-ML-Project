End to End Data Science Project

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts a student’s Math Score based on demographic and academic features using a complete pipeline consisting of data ingestion, data transformation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. The system loads the raw dataset, performs train–test splitting, applies preprocessing steps such as imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding, and evaluates multiple models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost, selecting the best-performing model based on test R² score using GridSearchCV. The trained model and preprocessing object are saved as artifacts and used in a prediction pipeline integrated with a Flask web application. The web UI accepts features such as gender, ethnicity, parent education, lunch type, preparation course, reading score, and writing score, processes them through the saved preprocessor and model, and displays the predicted Math Score. The project also includes structured logging, custom exception handling, modular code architecture, and a clean HTML interface. Throughout development, issues such as module import errors, value unpacking mismatches, environment inconsistencies, column naming errors, and form-field mismatches were resolved to ensure smooth training and deployment. Users can run the project by training the model through the data ingestion module and launching the Flask app to make real-time predictions.
